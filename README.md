This is a light task management tool. It supports adding, deleting, searching,
viewing all, and updating tasks.  
**How to use this tool:**  
First, you will need to download a server with support for php and mysql
specifically. I used the WAMP server from Bitnami that can be downloaded
[here](https://bitnami.com/stack/wamp).  
After you have that started, you will want to run init.php in the Creation files
to create the database itself. Then you will want to run table.php to create the
required table for the other files to use.  
After that, you can go to localhost/main.html to be brought to the main page of
the application, where you can start using the task manager.
